# OAuth Troubleshooting

## Connection Not Working

### Check 1: OAuth Connection Configured

Verify the OAuth connection exists:

-   Go to **Settings** → **OAuth Connections**
-   Check that the connection shows as "Connected"

### Check 2: Token Expired

Bifrost automatically refreshes tokens, but if a token is rejected before its stated expiry (common with providers like Pax8), you can refresh it programmatically:

```python
integration = await integrations.get("Pax8")
await integration.oauth.refresh()  # fetch fresh token
```

If the refresh token itself has expired:

1. Delete the existing OAuth connection
2. Re-authorize to get a fresh token

### Check 3: Scopes Correct

Ensure the OAuth app has the required scopes/permissions for your API calls.

## Using OAuth in Workflows

```python
from bifrost import workflow, oauth
import aiohttp

@workflow
async def call_graph_api():
    """Example Microsoft Graph API call."""
    conn = await oauth.get("microsoft")
    if not conn:
        return {"error": "Microsoft OAuth not configured"}

    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {conn['access_token']}"}

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(
            "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me",
            headers=headers
        ) as resp:
            return await resp.json()
```

## Common Errors

| Error                   | Cause                         | Fix                                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| "OAuth not configured"  | Connection doesn't exist      | Add OAuth connection in Settings             |
| 401 Unauthorized        | Token expired or wrong scopes | Call `oauth.refresh()`, or re-authorize      |
| "refresh_token invalid" | Refresh token revoked         | Delete and re-authorize                      |
